# ME405-Lab3

This repository allows the user to perform step response tests of 2 motors simultaneously. 

First, main.py must be run on the MCU. Then Computer_main.py must be run to get user input and send Kp and and setpoint values to the MCU, which performs the motor control tasks. After the step response test is complete, Computer_main.py will ask the user to type in "plot" to plot the graph of the step response test.
